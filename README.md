# Mini DevJam

Welcome to the Apigee mini hands on DevJam workshop.

# Getting Started

  In this workshop, you will get first hand exposure to Apigee Edge, the industry's leading API Management platform. To get started with Apigee Edge, you will need to create an account and set up a free trial instance of Apigee Edge that you can use to build our labs today.

  The instructor should have added you to the Apigee environment we'll be using in today's workshop. If you haven't received an email stating that "You've been added to an Apigee organization" please let your instructor know so he or she can add you.
